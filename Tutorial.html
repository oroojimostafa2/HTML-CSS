        Drilling Rigs
        <p>In order for drilling rigs to operate and extract oil and gas safely, it is necessary to mark these structures for passing vessels.</p>
        <p>Since drilling rigs operate in many different parts of the world, they must comply with the requirements of their current location.
            Thanks to our close relationship with the regulators and more than 45 years of experience, the most practical solution for drilling
            rigs is Orga.
        </p>
        <p>Our NavAids system is  a robust, durable and cost-effective digital solution for the demanding global offshore energy industries.
            The modular design of the digital control panel means it is easy to configure and maintain the system,
            also for different regulatory requirements in the world. The panel features a touchscreen user interface that
            makes full interaction possible so that the user can control and monitor the complete system.
